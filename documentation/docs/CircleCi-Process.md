## CircleCI Automated Integration Workflow

Whenever code is committed to the main branch of the repository, CircleCI initiates an automated build process through a continuous integration pipeline. The workflow encompasses the following key stages:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Prepare the environment by configuring necessary parameters for the subsequent stages.
  
2. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Install all essential dependencies required for building, testing, and deployment processes.

3. **Code Checkout:**
   - Retrieve the latest codebase from the main branch of the repository for processing.

4. **Dependency Installation (Backend and Frontend):**
   - Install the code dependencies for both the backend and frontend applications, ensuring all required packages are available.

5. **Frontend Linting:**
   - Execute linting procedures on the frontend codebase to ensure code consistency and adherence to best practices.

6. **Build Process:**
   - Build both the backend and frontend applications, transforming the source code into executable components.

7. **Pipeline Approval:**
   - Verify the integrity of the build and testing phases before proceeding to deployment.

8. **Backend API Deployment:**
   - Deploy the backend API application to the Elastic Beanstalk (EB) environment, ensuring the latest changes are reflected in the live environment.

9. **Frontend UI Deployment:**
   - Deploy the frontend UI application to the AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, making it accessible for end-users.

This automated integration workflow ensures a streamlined and efficient process from code commit to deployment, enhancing the reliability and consistency of the software delivery pipeline.
